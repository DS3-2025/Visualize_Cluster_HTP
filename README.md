# Visualize_Cluster_HTP
Applications of simple machine learning methods to predict outcomes leveraging HTP datasets.

For this exercise, we will be using the same data that you previously used for the linear regression session. You can find the data [here](https://github.com/DS3-2025/HTP_linear_regression_example/tree/main/data). You will also need the [helper_functions.R](https://github.com/DS3-2025/HTP_linear_regression_example/blob/main/helper_functions.R) file, also the same that you used previously in the linear regression session.
